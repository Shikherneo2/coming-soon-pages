<strong><span style="color:#CB2834; font-size:1.4em;">So, what is Sinedrive</span></strong><br /><br /> 
Sinedrive is an audio streaming service that has some really cool new features for the current generation of musicians, creators of audio, and their fans.<br /><br>
We at Sinedrive believe that every musician or creator of audio should only have to worry about his content. Sinedrive is a platform for anybody who wishes to put out content for the world to hear, be it a blockbuster musician or the average Joe showing off his newly acquired guitar skills! And why musicians, everybody is welcome! Audiobooks, podcasts, comedy shows- any audio content is welcome!
<br /><br />
Sinedrive offers great tools to boost your popularity in a neat yet powerful interface. Every track, album, and compilation is given a QR code. The possibilities are endless! You can put this up as your proﬁle picture on social networks or print it on merch and business cards. You could even stick it up on the bass drum during a performance! We also provide you with information on how well your content is spreading, complete with graphs and statistics.
<br><br>
The Sinedrive player is embeddable! This means you can put up your sines on any webpage! Your fans need not go to a different webpage to listen or download your sines. Downloads can be enabled or disabled.<br><br>

<strong><span style="color:#CB2834; font-size:1.4em;">Is it free ? </span></strong><br /><br /> 
Sinedrive allows you to upload as much content as you want to, and that too for free! So feel free to show off all those demos and bloopers too. We believe in a 'free' account model and not a 'freemium' one, unlike most others. Even your fans do not have to spend a nickel to enjoy the service.
<br><br>

<strong><span style="color:#CB2834; font-size:1.4em;"> Did I hear collaboration somewhere ? </span></strong><br /><br /> 
Sinedrive makes it easy for you to collaborate! Artists can update their proﬁles with their collaboration status and tell the world of artists whether they are open for collaboration and what crazy ideas interest them! They can even mention any particular artists they are interested in collaborating with. When both artists are open, they get a notiﬁcation (kinda like matchmaker for artists!). There is an unreleased space where two or more artists can put up their content and share their views. <br><br>

<strong><span style="color:#CB2834; font-size:1.4em;"> Yeah. But Music doesn't pay the bills, does it? </span></strong><br /><br /> 
It can. On Sinedrive, you can sell your music (in both digital and physical forms), merch, vinyls, and other promotional material. All you need is a PayPal account to get started. We accept payments from PayPal, credit cards, debit cards, net banking, and for the more savvy kinds, Bitcoin and Dogecoin payment modes are also available. Users also have the ability to tip each other. We take only a tiny cut from your sales i.e. 5%.<br><br> 
We believe in a revenue sharing model without ripping you off. Of all the ad revenue generated by you, 72% is all yours to take! Once you have been accepted in the Sinedrive Content Partners Programme, your revenue shall reﬂect in your account. Don't worry, its not an exclusive club or difﬁcult to get in. The moment we notice you are generating enough trafﬁc, we will automatically sign you up!
