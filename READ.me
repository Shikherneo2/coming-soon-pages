These are the coming soon pages for two projects I was involved in.

Travmunity was an idea about a travel marketplace. It never got off.

Sinedrive was a start-up taken on by me and a beloved friend of mine(you are sorely missed my friend). It was a music streaming service that tried to support the artists by allowing them to sell merchandise.

Use these projects as you wish.
